        Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on {companyName}'s website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

        *   Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on {companyName}'s website;
        *   Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
        *   Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

        This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by {companyName} at any time.

        ## 3. Disclaimer

        The materials on {companyName}'s website are provided on an 'as is' basis. {companyName} makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

        ## 4. Limitations

        In no event shall {companyName} or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on {companyName}'s website, even if {companyName} or a {companyName} authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.

        The materials appearing on {companyName}'s website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. {companyName} does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. {companyName} may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice.

        ## 6. Links

        {companyName} has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by {companyName} of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.
