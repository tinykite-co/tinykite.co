## The Stack Behind TinyKite

At TinyKite, performance isn't just a feature—it's a requirement. Here's how we achieve lightning-fast load times and smooth interactions across all our apps.

## Astro for Static Generation

We chose [Astro](https://astro.build) as our framework for several compelling reasons:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Only ship JS when absolutely necessary
- **Component Islands** - Hydrate interactive components independently
- **Flexible** - Works with React, Vue, Svelte, or vanilla JS
- **Fast builds** - Optimized build process for quick deployments

Our marketing site (the one you're reading now) is built entirely with Astro, delivering sub-second page loads.

## Tailwind CSS for Styling

Tailwind enables us to:

- Write styles quickly with utility classes
- Maintain consistency across components
- Keep bundle sizes small with automatic purging
- Support dark mode with ease

Our signature green theme (`#1DB954`) is defined once and used consistently throughout.

## MDX for Content

MDX combines Markdown's simplicity with React's power:

- Write content in familiar Markdown
- Embed interactive components when needed
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Version control friendly

## Vercel for Deployment

Vercel provides:

- Instant deployments from Git
- Global CDN for fast content delivery
- Automatic HTTPS
- Zero-configuration setup

## Performance Results

Our approach delivers impressive metrics:

- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.2s
- **Time to Interactive**: < 1.5s
- **Lighthouse Score**: 95+
- **Bundle Size**: Minimal (< 50KB initial)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Less JavaScript is More

Most interactions don't need JavaScript. We use progressive enhancement to deliver a fast baseline experience.

### 2. Optimize Images Aggressively

Images are often the biggest performance bottleneck. We use:
- WebP format with fallbacks
- Lazy loading for below-fold images
- Responsive images for different screen sizes

### 3. Measure Everything

We use performance budgets and monitor metrics continuously. What gets measured gets improved.

## Looking Forward

We're constantly exploring new ways to make our apps faster. Future experiments include:

- Edge computing for dynamic features
- Service workers for offline support
- Streaming responses for instant perceived performance

## Try It Yourself

Want to build fast web apps? Here's our starter checklist:

1. Choose a static-first framework (Astro, Next.js, etc.)
2. Minimize JavaScript bundles
3. Optimize images and assets
4. Use a CDN for global distribution
5. Monitor performance metrics

Speed matters. Your users will thank you.
